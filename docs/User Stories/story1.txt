1: LOGIN/REGISTRATION-
The login part requires the user to set up his/her account for the first time. Login is only
required for the first time the user uses the app or when users want to log back again. When the
user registers, they have to provide the following information: name, username, password. When the
user logs in, they need to provide only their username and password. The userâ€™s name/username will
be included with each sunset post/review they make (see story #3, story #4).
