2: FIND SUNSET/SUNRISE-
The user will specify a particular location, and then the app will give a report on the sunrise and sunset qualities in that location each day for the next week. Each sunrise/sunset will have a prediction value (from 0 to 100), which depends on the quality of the sunset and the quality of the weather at that time. Additionally, the app will tell the user some locations close to the one they specified that are convenient for viewing the sunrise/sunset (an open park, field, public observation deck, waterfront, etc.)
